        <section id="sun">
            <h3>Sun</h3>
            <div>It is massive: The Sun accounts for ~99.9% of the total mass of the solar system.</div>
            <div>The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion happening <b>inside the core</b>.</div>
            <div>The Sun heavily impacts space weather, and it could damage satellites and power grids on Earth.</div>
            <div>The Sun isn't actually totally yellow, as its real color is close to white.</div>
        </section>

        <section id="mercury">
            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <div>The most boring planet in the solar system.</div>
            <div>One year on Mercury only lasts 88 earth-days.</div>
            <div>It is so cratered and desolate that it could easily pass for the Moon's more rugged, planet-sized cousin.</div>
            <div>Only two spacecraft have visited Mercury so far, and it is extremely hard to see from Earth.</div>
            <div>Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest.</div>
            <div>In the future Mercury's orbit may become unstable and it will either crash into the Sun or Venus or Earth or flung out of the Solar System.</div>
        </section>

        <section id="venus">
            <h3>Venus</h3>
            <div>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures around 465째C (869째F).</div>
            <div>It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, creating an intense greenhouse effect.</div>
            <div>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.</div>
            <div>Despite its harsh conditions, scientists believe Venus may have once had liquid water and possibly even life.</div>
            <div>Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, though their environments are vastly different.</div>
            <div>Its surface is covered with volcanoes and vast lava plains, making it one of the most volcanically active places in the solar system.</div>
            <div>Venus could technically be colonized using giant blimps floating in the upper atmosphere of the planet.</div>
        </section>
        
        <section id="earth">
            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <div>Earth is the only known planet to support life, thanks to its liquid water and protective atmosphere.</div>
            <div>About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands.</div>
            <div>Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by its liquid outer core, which protects us from harmful solar radiation.</div>
            <div>The planet's tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees is responsible for the changing seasons.</div>
            <div>Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases.</div>
            <div>Our planet is home to over 8 million known species, with millions more yet to be discovered, but a million of them goes extinct every year.</div>

        <section id="mars">
            <h3>Mars</h3>
            <div>Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.</div>
            <div>It has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands about 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) high.</div>
            <div>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system, sometimes covering the entire planet for months.</div>
            <div>Scientists have found evidence of ancient river valleys and lakes, suggesting Mars once had liquid water.</div>
            <div>The Martian day, called a "sol," is approximately 24.6 hours, very similar to Earth's 24-hour day.</div>
            <div>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.</div>
        </section>
        
        <section id="jupiter">
            <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <div>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass more than twice that of all other planets combined.</div>
            <div>It has a Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has been raging for over 300 years.</div>
            <div>Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, 14 times stronger than Earth's, creating intense radiation belts.</div>
            <div>The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface.</div>
            <div>Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</div>
            <div>Its rapid rotation causes Jupiter to have a noticeable oblate shape, being flattened at the poles.</div>
        </section>
        
        <section id="saturn">
            <h3>Saturn</h3>
            <div>Saturn is renowned for its stunning ring system, composed of ice and rock particles ranging in size.</div>
            <div>It is the second-largest planet in our solar system and is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium.</div>
            <div>Saturn has at least 83 moons, with Titan being the largest and the second-largest moon in the solar system.</div>
            <div>The planet's low density means it would float if there were a bathtub large enough to hold it.</div>
            <div>Saturn experiences powerful storms, including the long-lasting hexagonal storm at its north pole.</div>
            <div>Its rings are relatively young, estimated to be only about 100 million years old.</div>
        </section>
        
        <section id="uranus">
            <h3>Uranus</h3>
            <div>Uranus is unique for its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side.</div>
            <div>The planet has a faint ring system and is composed mainly of ice and gas, including water, ammonia, and methane.</div>
            <div>Uranus has 27 known moons, named mostly after characters from literature, such as Titania and Oberon.</div>
            <div>Its methane-rich atmosphere gives Uranus its distinctive blue-green color.</div>
            <div>Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any planet in the solar system, with temperatures dropping to -224째C (-371째F).</div>
            <div>The planet rotates very slowly, taking about 17 hours to complete one rotation on its axis.</div>
        </section>
        
        <section id="neptune">
            <h3>Neptune</h3>
            <div>Neptune is the most distant planet from the Sun in our solar system, located about 4.5 billion kilometers away.</div>
            <div>It has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 mph).</div>
            <div>Neptune's Great Dark Spot is a massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, though it can appear and disappear over time.</div>
            <div>The planet has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest, featuring geysers that suggest a subsurface ocean.</div>
            <div>Neptune is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a deep blue color.</div>
            <div>Its rotation period is about 16 hours, making a Neptunian day much shorter than an Earth day.</div>

            <h3>The Sun</h3>
            <p>It is massive: The Sun accounts for ~99.9% of the total mass of the solar system.</p>
            <p>The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion happening <b>inside the core</b>.</p>
            <p>The Sun heavily impacts space weather, and it could damage satellites and power grids on Earth.</p>
            <p>The Sun isn't actually totally yellow, as its real color is close to white.</p>

        <section id="mercury">
            <h3>Mercury</h3>
            <p>The most boring planet in the solar system.</p>
            <p>One year on Mercury only lasts 88 earth-days.</p>
            <p>It is so cratered and desolate that it could easily pass for the Moon's more rugged, planet-sized cousin.</p>
            <p>Only two spacecraft have visited Mercury so far, and it is extremely hard to see from Earth.</p>
            <p>In the future, Mercury's orbit may become unstable, and it could either crash into the Sun or Venus or Earth or be flung out of the Solar System.</p>

        <section id="venus">
            <h3>Venus</h3>
            <p>Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures around 465Â°C (869Â°F).</p>
            <p>It has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, creating an intense greenhouse effect.</p>
            <p>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.</p>
            <p>Despite its harsh conditions, scientists believe Venus may have once had liquid water and possibly even life.</p>
            <p>Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition, though their environments are vastly different.</p>
            <p>Its surface is covered with volcanoes and vast lava plains, making it one of the most volcanically active places in the solar system.</p>
            <p>Venus could technically be colonized using giant blimps floating in the upper atmosphere of the planet.</p>

        <section id="earth">
            <h3>Earth</h3>
            <p>Earth is the only known planet to support life, thanks to its liquid water and protective atmosphere.</p>
            <p>About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands.</p>
            <p>Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by its liquid outer core, which protects us from harmful solar radiation.</p>
            <p>The planet's tilt of approximately 23.5 degrees is responsible for the changing seasons.</p>
            <p>Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases.</p>
            <p>Our planet is home to over 8 million known species, with millions more yet to be discovered, but a million of them goes extinct every year.</p>

        <section id="mars">
            <h3>Mars</h3>
            <p>Mars is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.</p>
            <p>It has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands about 22 kilometers (13.6 miles) high.</p>
            <p>Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system, sometimes covering the entire planet for months.</p>
            <p>Scientists have found evidence of ancient river valleys and lakes, suggesting Mars once had liquid water.</p>
            <p>The Martian day, called a "sol," is approximately 24.6 hours, very similar to Earth's 24-hour day.</p>
            <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids, and could become rings in a few <u>million</u> years.</p>

        <section id="jupiter">
            <h3>Jupiter</h3>
            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass more than twice that of all other planets combined.</p>
            <p>It has a Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has been raging for over 300 years.</p>
            <p>Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, 14 times stronger than Earth's, creating intense radiation belts.</p>
            <p>The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface.</p>
            <p>Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.</p>
            <p>Its rapid rotation causes Jupiter to have a noticeable oblate shape, being flattened at the poles.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="saturn">
            <h3>Saturn</h3>
            <p>Saturn is renowned for its stunning ring system, composed of ice and rock particles ranging in size.</p>
            <p>It is the second-largest planet in our solar system and is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <p>Saturn has at least 83 moons, with Titan (a moon with a full fledged atmosphere comparable to Earth's!) being the largest and the second-largest moon in the solar system.</p>
            <p>The planet's low density means it would float if there were a bathtub large enough to hold it.</p>
            <p>Saturn experiences powerful storms, including the long-lasting hexagonal storm at its north pole.</p>
            <p>Its rings are relatively young, estimated to be <b><u>only</u></b> about 100 million years old.</p>
            <p class="warning">Saturn's rings didn't render properly, I'll fix this problem soonTM</p>

        <section id="uranus">
            <h3>Uranus</h3>
            <p>Uranus is unique for its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, causing it to rotate on its side, and also having a <i>funny ðŸ™„ name</i>.</p>
            <p>The planet has a faint ring system and is composed mainly of ice and gas, including water, ammonia, and methane.</p>
            <p>Uranus has 27 known moons, named mostly after characters from literature, such as Titania and Oberon.</p>
            <p>Its methane-rich (a gas which cow burps btw) atmosphere gives Uranus its distinctive blue-green color.</p>
            <p>Uranus has the coldest atmosphere of any planet in the solar system, with temperatures dropping to -224Â°C (-371Â°F).</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="neptune">
            <h3>Neptune</h3>
            <p>Neptune is the most distant planet <i>(sorry Pluto)</i> from the Sun in our solar system, located about 4.5 billion kilometers away.</p>
            <p>It has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 kilometers per hour (1,300 mph).</p>
            <p>Neptune's Great Dark Spot is a massive storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot, though it can appear and disappear over time.</p>
            <p>The planet has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest, featuring geysers that suggest a subsurface ocean (that could host life!).</p>
            <p>Neptune is composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it a deep blue color.</p>
            <p>Its rotation period is about 16 hours, making a Neptunian day much shorter than an Earth day.</p>
